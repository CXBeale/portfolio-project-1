## Features 

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar and Logo__

  - Featured on the top of the home page, the fully responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo (Home), Home page, Support, About, and Contact pages. It will be identical on all pages, allowing users to easily navigate between pages.
  - the navigation bar was taken from bootstrap and modifications were made for the colour, the alignment of text, logo placement, and links.
  - The default bar contains aria accesibility for current page and toggle menu. 
  - Navbar responsiveness: as the page expands over medium (md screens), the toggle menu is replaced by page links.
  - The navigation uses a sticky top display format and will remain at the top of the page as the user scrolls the page.
  - The navbar also uses box-shadow and elevated z-index to give it a feel of being above the rest of the page.
  - The logo was designed using copilot image generation, directed to create a sleek line design representing the websites image. It gives a sense of simplicity, clarity, and calmness. 


- __The Header and Hero image__

  - The hero image was chosen to evoke a sense of calm in the user. 
  - The header contains the name of the site followed by a slogan or mission statement.
  beneath this is the call to action button which moves the user to sign up and share stories.



- __Welcome section__

  - the welcome section outlines the purpose of the site and introduces quick links for the user to access help services.


- __Advice section__

  - this section provides information and guidance on how to improve ones mental health

  - __Contact section__

  - This section allows the user to connect to clearmind through an application form. the form was taken from bootstrap and adjusted for the format and style of the website.
  - it also provides all links to social media sites.


- __The Footer__ 

  - The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for Love Running. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. 
  - The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea
- refining features are required for the alignment of cads in responsive screen set ups.

## Testing 

For the testing of the site, the responsiveness was checked at each level to ensure the mobile first responsive design adjusted seemlessly according to screen size.
- Bootstrap grid layouts and media queries wee used to ensure this responsiveness could be achieved.
- manual testing also reveled that links and toggle menus would go to where they were supposed to. for example the logo will take you to the hoimepage, or the connect CTA button links top the bottom of the page in the connect section.
