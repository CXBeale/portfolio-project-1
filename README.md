# How AI and Google search Was Used 

Artificial Intelligence played a significant role in the development of this project. Here are some ways AI was utilized:

- Code Generation

     - AI tools like GitHub Copilot were used to generate code snippets for various parts of the     website. This included HTML structure and CSS styling. The AI provided context-aware suggestions  that helped streamline the coding process and reduce development time.

- Debugging

    - AI-powered debugging tools were utilized to identify and fix issues in the code. These tools analyzed the codebase, detected potential bugs, and provided recommendations for resolving them. This ensured a smoother development process and a more robust final product.

- Image Generation

    - DALL-E, an AI model developed by OpenAI, was used to generate the images for the website. Squoosh was used to resize the images. 

- Content Assistance

    - AI tools like GitHub Copilot were used to assist in writing code and content for the website. These tools provided suggestions and auto-completions, which sped up the development process and ensured high-quality code.

- Accessibility Improvements

  - AI was used to analyze the website's accessibility features. Tools like Lighthouse provided insights into how accessible the website is for users with disabilities and suggested improvements to enhance user experience.

- Text & Content

    - Used Google searcha and AI-Copilot was used to search all the text content, suggestions, definitions, descriptions etc.


By utilising AI, the project was able to achieve a higher level of efficiency, creativity, and accessibility.
