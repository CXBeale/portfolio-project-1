  - The navbar also uses box-shadow and elevated z-index to give it a feel of being above the rest of the page.

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea

## Testing 

For the testing of the site, the responsiveness was checked at each level to ensure the mobile first responsive design adjusted seemlessly according to screen size.
- Bootstrap grid layouts and media queries wee used to ensure this responsiveness could be achieved.
- manual testing also reveled that links and toggle menus would go to where they were supposed to. for example the logo will take you to the hoimepage, or the connect CTA button links top the bottom of the page in the connect section.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  -validation was carried ou by directly validating the code from the inspected web page in the validation site linked here. https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input.
  the file had no errors

  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
